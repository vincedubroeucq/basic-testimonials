Basic Testimonials allows you to add testimonials to your site via a super easy to use [testimonial] shortcode.

== Description ==

Activating this plugin will create a 'Testimonials' entry in your admin area. Just create a new testimonial, upload a picture of your client, type in their website, and hit publish !
If you need help while editing the testimonial, click the help button in the top right corner.
You can embed a nice blockquote with your testimonial by using the [testimonial] shortcode in your article content, page content, or even text widget.
There are two optionnal parameters to the shortcode.

* [testimonial] will display a random testimonial.
* [testimonial id=123] will display the specific testimonial with the id of 123.
* [testimonial name="testimonial-slug"] will display the specific testimonial with the slug of 'testimonial-slug'.
* [testimonial id= 123 name="testimonial-slug"] : When you provide both an id and a name, only the name is used.

The plugin also provides a front end submission form. Now users can directly submit their testimonials when visiting your site.
To display the form, all you have to do is use the [testimonial-form] shortcode in your page. 
This will generate a simple form where users can type in their name, website url, comment and even upload a picture.
If the process went fine the user will get a preview of his testimonial, and you'll just have to approve it in your backend before using it.
